Installation
------------

Chdir to the project directory and run `cabal install`. The main executable
will be placed in your ~cabal/bin folder.

Usage
-----

You can use this utility to perform simple operations on GIF87a-files.
Since GIF-files with this exact format are hard to come by these days,
use ImageMagick's convert to convert other images to GIF87a.

  convert input.jpg output.gif87

The main application executable, gif87a, takes as its arguments a
list of gif87a-files. The output will depend on the given options:

  -e --encode     Re-encode the images
  -p --parse      Show the parsed image
  -t --transform  Apply transformations to each image

Code
----

Source-code can be found in the GIF87a-folder, the main executable in
GIF87a.hs. The code is organized as follows

  GIF87a.Image:           datatype for parsed images
  GIF87a.Parser:          AttoParsec-parser
  GIF87a.Encoder:         image encoder
  GIF87a.Transformations: some higher order functions and predefined
                          transformations on images
  GIF87a.LZW              implementation of the GIF LZW alorithm

Some tests can be found in the test-folder.
